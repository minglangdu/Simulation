The following is a list of attributes that objects may have:
*Italic* characters aren't part of the attribute name and are comments.

**difficulty**: how much movement in terrain is slowed.

*only a difficulty of -1 makes it impossible to go to the square*
*positive difficulties hinder movement but cannot stop it completely*
*(there is a minimum)*

**placeholder**: not an attribute

Just shows how format works:
bold attribute, definition, linebreak, further comments, double br
